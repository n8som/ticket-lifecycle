<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
Stage 1: Intake

  A new ticket is created at this first stage. There are a couple of ways I can submit a ticket, either by filling out a form, like the one shown here or by sending an email to a designated ticketing address. When someone fills out the form, they provide contact information, describe the topic/issue, and provide all the necessary details about the problem.

Stage 2: Assignment and Communication

  Once a ticket is submitted, it gets assigned to an IT professional. To ensure a ticket is handled properly, the severity level may be adjusted. In this case, I change the Priority to "Emergency", the SLA Plan to "SEV-A", and assign the ticket to the "System Administrators" department.

Stage 3: Working the Issue

  Now that the ticket has been assigned to the appropriate department and professionals, the IT staff can start working on finding a solution to the issue. Throughout the process, any changes or updates related to the ticket can be recorded in the Ticket Thread. This way, everyone involved can stay informed about the progress and communicate with each other.

<p>
Stage 4: Resolution

  Once the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be marked as closed. In the osTicket system, closed tickets are moved from the Open section to the Closed section. As an IT professional, it's crucial to know where to find closed tickets since they can provide valuable insights and solutions for similar tickets that may arise in the future.
